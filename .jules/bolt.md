## 2024-05-22 - [Redundant KeyPair Storage]
**Learning:** The `KeyBox` record was storing both the Bouncy Castle `PEMKeyPair` (intermediate) and the Java `KeyPair` (final). This doubled the object overhead for every key loaded.
**Action:** Always check if intermediate parsing objects are being stored in long-lived data structures. Remove them once the final object is created.

## 2024-05-24 - [Redundant IPC Calls in Hot Paths]
**Learning:** `CertHack.createApplicationId` and `Config.getPatchLevel` were making direct IPC calls to `PackageManager` for every key generation/hacking attempt. This is expensive. `Config` already had an LRU cache (`packageCache`) but it was private and underutilized.
**Action:** Expose existing internal caches (safely) to related components (like `CertHack`) instead of re-fetching data via IPC.

## 2026-02-03 - [Synchronized Streams in Recursive Encoders]
**Learning:** `CborEncoder` was using `ByteArrayOutputStream` for every recursive call. Since `ByteArrayOutputStream` methods are synchronized, this added significant overhead for complex nested structures (like RKP payloads). Replacing it with a non-synchronized `FastByteArrayOutputStream` yielded a >50% speedup.
**Action:** In high-throughput serialization logic, avoid synchronized streams (like `ByteArrayOutputStream`) if thread confinement is guaranteed. Use custom unsynchronized implementations or buffers.
